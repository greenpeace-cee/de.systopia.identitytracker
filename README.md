# Contact Identity Tracker

CiviCRM contacts are identified by their CiviCRM ID and, optionally, an external
identifier, which is a single-calue filed on *Contact* entities.

This extension provides means for keeping track of multiple identifiers of
different configurable types for *Contact* entities by adding a multi-value
custom field group and an API for easily identifying contacts by those ID
records.
